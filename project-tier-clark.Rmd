# Reproducibility: why should you care?

## Think back to every time...

- The results in Table 1 don't seem to correspond to those in Figure 2.
- In what order do I run these scripts?
- Where did we get this data file?
- Why did I omit those samples?
- How did I make that figure?
- "Your script is now giving an error."
- "The attached is similar to the code we used."

Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, <br>
but you don’t reply to emails.

# 1. Version control

## What is version control?

- a system that records changes to files over time 
- recall specific versions later

## Better - Saving everything together at once

Everytime you save:

    - zip the entire directory 
    - save it with a date


## Best - Version Control

## How does a version control system work? {.smaller}

- Start with a base version of the document, save just the changes you made at each step of the way.

- Think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest version.

<center>
<img src="img/play-changes.png" width="400px" />
</center>

- "Playing back" different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document.

## Git/GitHub

- Easy to set up
- Integrated with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com)
- GitHub's strong community: your colleagues are probably already there
- Provides tools to help enhance collaboration
- A common location to share your work

> Note: GitHub repositories are **public**. 
> Can request private repositories for education or research

# Project TIER on GitHub

## Project TIER

You can find the folder structures outlined in the TIER Protocol in the
Project TIER organization on GitHub:

https://github.com/ProjectTIER

- For R: Repository is called `ProjectTIER_R`
- For STATA: Repository **will be** called `ProjectTIER_STATA` (in progress)

## Fork

- Create a GitHub account if you don't yet have one: https://github.com/
- Form the `ProjectTIER_R` repository, which will create a copy in your account



# 2. Literate programming

## Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1983)"

"Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a *computer* what 
to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to *human beings* what we 
want a computer to do."

"The practitioner of literate programming [...] strives for a program that 
is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order 
that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and 
informal methods that reinforce each other."

- These ideas have been around for years!
- and tools for putting them to practice have also been around
- but they have never been as accessible as the current tools


## A better solution than just R

With RStudio you can combine your programming and your documentation

<div class="columns-2">
- Gives you a single environment to combine your documentation and your
analysis
- Runs on top of R

## What is Markdown?

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating HTML (or XHTML) 
documents.

- Markup languages are designed to produce documents from human readable 
text (and annotations).

- Some of you may be familiar with LaTeX. This is another (less human 
friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

- Why I love Markdown:
    + Simple syntax means easy to learn and use.
    + Focus on **content**, rather than **coding** and debugging 
    **errors**.
    + Allows for easy web authoring.
    + Once you have the basics down, you can get fancy and add HTML,
    JavaScript, and CSS.

## Sample Markdown document

## What is R Markdown?

Well, it's R + Markdown:

- Ease of Markdown syntax

- Rendering of R code to produce output and plots

## Sample R Markdown document

# 3. Scriptability

## Point-and-click vs. scripting

- Learning curve: Point-and-click software (supposedly) have shallower learning curves than scripting languages

- Documentation: At a minimum, your code documents your analysis
    + And you can do better with comments and README files

- Automation: Need to rerun your analysis with new/updated data? Just change the input file.

- Collaboration: Sharing your analysis is as easy as sharing your scripts

## Why R?

<div class="columns-2">
- Programming language for data analysis
- Free!
- Open source
- Widely used and supported across all disciplines
- Can be used on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux
- Thousands of statistical data analysis packages

![RSplashScreen](img/RSplash.png)
</div>


## Why not language X?

- There are a number of other great programming tools out there that can also be 
used to improve the reproducibility of your analysis

- The key is to use some type of language that will allow you to automate and 
document your analysis

- Once you master one language you'll probably find it easier to learn another


## Once in R

<div class="columns-2">
You could just type into the command prompt, but that doesn't help much with

- documentation

or

- automation

## Example: Occupational Wages around the World

The [OWW database](http://www.nber.org/oww/) contains occupational wage data for 161 
occupations in 171 countries from 1983 to 2008. The occupational wage data are derived from 
the [ILO October Inquiry database](http://laborsta.ilo.org) by calibrating the data into a 
normalized wage rate for each occupation. The normalized wages refer to average hourly or 
monthly wage rates for adult workers.

<br><br>

Load data with an **R chunk**:

```{r}
load("processing-and-analysis/analysis-data/oww.RData")
```

<br><br>

<font size="3">Source: http://www.nber.org/oww/</font>

## Under the hood

<img src="img/rchunk.png" alt="rchunk" style="width:900px">

## View data {.smaller}
```{r}
oww
```

## Clean data

You can include script files in your R Markdown document

```{r message=FALSE}
source("processing-and-analysis/command-files/02-data-cleanup.R")
```

<img src="img/script.png" alt="script" style="width:600px">

## View distribution of `hw1` {.smaller}

```{r message=FALSE, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(oww, aes(x = hw1)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
summary(oww$hw1)
```

## Regress hourly vs. monthly and exchange rate {.smaller}

```{r message=FALSE}
m_hw1_mw1 <- lm(hw1 ~ mw1 * exrt_cat, data = oww)
summary(m_hw1_mw1)
```

## Plot hourly vs. monthly and exchange rate {.smaller}

```{r message=FALSE, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = oww, aes(x = mw1, y = hw1, color = exrt_cat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Math typesetting

LaTeX:

$\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x$

## Set up git in RStudio

We're going to avoid local installation for now...

Go to https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers

- Log in with your Duke NetID
- Click on RStudio which will launch an R session for you

In RStudio:

- Go to Tools -> Shell
- Type the two lines of code, replacing my information with your own
    
~~~
$ git config --global user.name "Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel"
$ git config --global user.email "mine@stat.duke.edu"
~~~

## Clone

In RStudio:

- Go to File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git
- Go back to your forked GitHub repo and copy the HTTPS URL
- Insert this into Repository URL
- Click on Create Project

## Edit, stage, commit, push

- Edit one of the Markdown files

- Go to the Git page in RStudio
    + Stage changes by checking the box
    + Commit (with an informative message)
    + Push

- View your changes on GitHub

## git/GitHub, why?

**Most powerful argument:** Automatic tracking of changes

**Other arguments:**

- No download/upload
- Ease of collaboration with ability to resolve merge conflicts
- Searchability
- ...

# Parting remarks

## Two-pronged approach

Everyone struggles with reproducibility and it is a hindrance to moving 
science forward.

<div class="columns-2">
\#1 
Adopt a reproducible research workflow

<br><br>

\#2
Train new researchers who don’t have any other workflow
